# Linux-VM
This project consists of a guide to walk user through the process of setting up a Linux-based Virtual Machine (VM) from from start to end. It provides instructions for setting up the environment. Whether this is the first setting up a virtual machine or your looking for a structured guide, I created this project to help you through the process.
